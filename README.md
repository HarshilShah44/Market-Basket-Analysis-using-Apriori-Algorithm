Market Basket Analysis (MBA) is a data mining technique used by retailers to understand the purchase behavior of customers. It involves analyzing the items that are frequently purchased together to uncover patterns and relationships in the data. The goal is to identify associations between products that are often bought together and use this information to improve marketing strategies, optimize product placement, and increase sales.

Overview
This project aims to perform market basket analysis using Python. Market basket analysis is a data mining technique used by retailers to understand customer purchase behavior and generate insights that can inform marketing strategies and product placements.

Tools Used
Python
Pandas
NumPy
Matplotlib
Seaborn
mlxtend (for Apriori algorithm)

Steps
Importing Libraries: Start by importing the necessary libraries for data manipulation, visualization, and market basket analysis.

Data Loading: Load the transactional data into a DataFrame. Perform any necessary data cleaning and preprocessing steps.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Change the datatype of the date column from object to date.
Explore the data to gain insights into customer purchase behavior.
Use charts (e.g., bar charts, countplots) to visualize patterns and trends in the data.
Market Basket Analysis:

Use the Apriori algorithm to identify frequent itemsets in the transactional data.
Generate association rules based on the frequent itemsets to understand relationships between products.
Use metrics such as support, confidence, and lift to evaluate the association rules and gain insights.
Interpretation:

Analyze the association rules to identify meaningful patterns and relationships between products.
Use the insights gained from the analysis to inform marketing strategies, product placements, and other business decisions.
